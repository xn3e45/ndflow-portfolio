    <p class="about-txt">Hey, I’m Ndene welcome to my page. This page is used to showcase all development I do whether it’s web, mobile or software you can see everything I’ve completed or currently working on. As long as I can remember I’ve always had an interest in
      the development of technology. In my family I’d handle any technological issue, if anyone needed any help I was the go-to guy. Eventually I realized the potential I had with the skills I had developed over-time helping my family, so thats when
      I decided to study computer science. I’m currently studying computer science at Diablo Valley College and look forward to what the future holds. If you have any inquires please contact me from any of the socials links above.</p>

      <p>This is a Front-end web development project where I was able to grasp a solid foundation on using CSS grids. I now feel confident in using CSS grids in more of my projects move forward.</p>

      <h1>Single Price Grid Page</h1>
      <p>I used CSS grid along with flexbox in order to achieve this look. I'd say this one of the first instances of me using flexbox, it was quite easy and I'd even go to say a fundamental part in understanding the box model.</p>

      <h1>Huddle Landing Page</h1>
      <p>I decided to use CSS grid when developing this, I could've easily used flexbox and had the same outcome but at the time I was still getting familiar with CSS grid. What I took away from this project would defintely be positioning and sizing
        the background using an SVG. Made responsive using media query.</p>

      <p>When I saw this challenge I knew it was the perfect oppurtunity to test my HTML & CSS skills and seeing how fast I'd be able to build it. I was able to complete this challenge in a matter of 10min due to it's simplicity. I'm not one to rush
        but it was a good way to challenge myself when no challenge seemed present in its development.</p>

        believe this was also one of the first times I decided to use CSS grid. This challenge pushed me past the bounds of what I already knew.</p>
